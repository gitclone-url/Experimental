👋 I'm a self-taught coder and a passionate tech enthusiast who's all about open source and building fun projects in my free time. While I'm not a professional developer, I absolutely love tinkering with code and exploring new technologies.

💻 Coding is my happy place, and I'm constantly curious about various programming languages and technologies.

📱 I'm a big fan of Android OS and 🐧 Linux, and I thoroughly enjoy customizing my Android phone.

🌿 Nature lover, tech explorer, and an enthusiastic hodophile with a dream to travel every part of the world.
